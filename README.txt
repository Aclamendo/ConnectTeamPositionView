*********************
Steps (2 Major Parts)
*********************
Part One: Collect the data
 1. Open the shift scheduler in Connecteam
 2. Copy and paste the contents on 'inject.js' into the developer console
 3. Click on the position view button and save the 'shifts.csv'

Part Two: Make the data look pretty
  1. Drag the shifts.csv file onto 'position_view.exe'
    a. If Windows complains about running the app, allow it and continue
  2. Wait a few seconds and a graph should show up with everyone's schedules
